    <h2 class="story-title">This is my story.</h2>
    <p>I'm a mix of Japanese and Korean. I was a curious child who think about social issues or global environment so I majored in Agricultural Development in Tokyo University of Agriculture. I studied how to improve people's life, especially in rural area of Africa.
        After graduated from the University, I was supposed to go abroad to work in the area but I couldn't due to COVID-19.</p>
    <img src="images/portfolio.baby.png" alt="">
    <p>This was the turning point.
        I seeked what I should do, what I really want to do and how I can contribute in this world.
        Finally, I found the answer. This is the programming. I love trying new things, creating something and working as a team. My passion is here.</p>

                <h3>Journey is my life.</h3>
                <p>First of all, I love traveling. I've been to India, Cuba, Jamaica, Turkey, Morrocco, Spain, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam by myself  when I was 18-19. Lost? Fear? Loneliness? Those feelings are parts of  joy in the journey and makes me strong.  Jumping in new area is my favorite.
